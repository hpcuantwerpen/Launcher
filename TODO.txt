TODO LIST

- the config file is in fact a session configuration
  Things would probably be more practical if we had a session configuration file
  (selectable by user) and a Launcher config file


- fix compile time warnings on macosx

- win32 version
- windows 8 version
- windows 10 version
- linux version

- script syntax highlighting

- update mechanism for .info files
  ?pick up most recent version from cluster itself?
  if that is feasible, we might provide a link to the newest Launcher version as well.

- add mpi functionality

- add checkpointing of jobs

- add icon to mac application

DONE (reverse chronological order)
==================================
2015-11-09
- templates:
  . could be implemented as session config files : not a good idea, script is not
    in config file, on script parameters
  . as a complete job with some functionality to copy the entire directory (including
    any input files)
- delete job must kill it if not finished
- add a dummy entry at the beginning of the module list
- make ExecuteRemoteCommand a member of ssh2::Session instead of of MainWindow
  in this way the commands executed by sftp_get/put_file/dir can be wrapped too.
- intercept “internet connection but no vpn”
- intercept “no internet connection”


2015-11-07
- bug fix: sftp_put_dir writes only one memory block (mem)
2015-11-06
- add hello world example
- bug fix: authentication lost after
  after authenticate, wUsername gets focus again and generates another on_wUsername_EditingFinished event
  wich accidentally called ssh2::Session::reset()
- bug fix: the user can select the output of the qstat -u command as if it was a job,
  because it started also with ">>>"

2015-11-05ß
- cut off log file

2015-11-04
- bug fix: git revision of pure tag leads to version unknown.
- bug fix: mkdir -p fails : ssh2::Session::autoOpen not set
- set local file location by default to ~/Launcher
      subfolder to [~/Launcher/]jobs
      job_name to hello_world_example
- bug fix: select jobname possible without subfolder?
  > QDir::cleanPath(...) added to test whether selections are indeed descendents of subfolder, resp. local file location.

2015-10-30
- wall time format has now two decimals to avoid confusion: 1,000 hours = 1 hour and not 1000 hours
- windows 7 64bit distribution working

2015-10-28
- bug fix: from retrieve page to script page script is not shown
- bug fix: sftp_get_dir cannot handle remote environment variables, replace $VSC_xxx in joblist
- bug fix: save on page script not working for commands added
- bug fix: delete selected job not working
- bug fix: touch finished.<jobid> not automatically added to existing scripts, when they are not modified.
- bug fix: test for finished.<jobid> requires long id, not just the number
- bug fix: reload not working
- make remote commands insensitive to user environment.
- when is a job finished?
  (when finished.<jobid> exists in the remote directory) and ( (the job is in stat, marked as completed) or (the job is not in stat) )
