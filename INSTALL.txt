1. Dependencies
================

Launcher is a graphical user interface written in Python using wxPython for the 
graphical components and paramiko for connecting (via SSH) to the VSC clusters. 
Any standard Python distribution satisfying the following requirements will do:
  - python version 2.7.x. (python 3.x was not tested). 
    You can check your Python version with the command
      > python --version
  - installed package: paramiko, version > 1.15.2
  - installed package: wxPython, version > 2.8.10
These dependencies can be installed separately (see 2.), but it is generally more 
practical to install a Python distribution that supports these packages out of the
 box, such as Enthought/Canopy.

2. Installing dependencies separately
======================================
2a. Linux, MacOSX
------------------
On Mac OS X and most Linux distributions Python is a standard component, and the
above dependencies can be easily installed by executing (sudo)
  > pip install paramiko
  > pip install wxPython
If you have ar recent Python version (2.7.9 or higher) pip is already on your 
system. If not, check the pip installation instructions at 
	https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html
(or google for "pip install").

2b. Windows
------------
The Windows operating systems do not come with Python installed and windows users
must install a Python distribution first. The most practical way is to opt for a
Python distribution that already has wxPython and paramiko (see 3.)

3. Installing Enthought/Canopy Python 
======================================
This the is recommended approach on Linux/MacOSX/Windows unless you have
a lot of experience with Python installations
A very good Python distribution that provides many common Python packages out
of the box is Enthought/Canopy. Among many other very useful packages for 
scientific work, it has direct support for wxPython and paramiko. In addition
it is free.
Proceed as follows:
3.1 Download and install the latest version of Enthought Canopy Express from 
		https://store.enthought.com
	You will be asked to create an account, don't mind, it is free. You may
	apply for an academic license to have additional benefits. 
    Select your operating system (Windows,Linux,Mac) and version (64-bit,32-bit)
    and click "DOWNLOAD Canopy Express"
    Execute the downloaded file
3.2 Open the canopy application and go to the "package manager" in the middle 
	of the window.
    install wxPython version > 2.8.10
    install paramiko version > 1.15.2
 
4. Getting Launcher with git
=============================
4.1 Linux/MacOSX
-----------------
    1. Open a terminal (Linux/MacOSX)
    2. cd into your home folder
    	> cd
    3. create a Launcher folder and cd into it
    	> mkdir Launcher
    	> cd Launcher
    4. get the launcher files
        > git clone https://github.com/hpcuantwerpen/Launcher.git
 	
5. Getting Launcher without git
================================
1. Download the Launcher-master.zip from https://github.com/hpcuantwerpen/Launcher
   by pressing the "Download ZIP" button on the right. 
2. In the file manager of our OS, navigate to your home folder and create
   a new folder "Launcher"
3. Navigate to your "Downloads" folder and unzip the Launcher-master.zip. This  
   will usually create a folder "Launcher-master" with the Launcher files
4. rename the folder into "Launcher" and move the entire folder into the 
   "Launcher" folder created above. The folder structure should now look more
   or less like this:
   
   <your_home_folder>
   +-- Launcher
   |   +-- Launcher
   |       +-- clusters
   |       |   +-- __init__.py
   |       |   +-- Hopper.py
   |       |   +-- Turing.py
   |       |   +-- ...
   |       +-- BashEditor.py
   |       +-- INSTALL.txt
   |       +-- README.md
   |       +-- TODO.txt
   |       +-- indent.py
   |       +-- launch.py
   |       +-- log.py
   |       +-- pbs.py
   |       +-- sshtools.py
   |       +-- wxtools.py
   |       +-- xx.py
   |       +-- ...
   
   Note that you should see two levels of Launcher folders.

Working from home
=================
If you want to use the Launcher from anywhere else than at work you must connect
to your home institution using a VPN client as always. Students and Researchers 
of the University of Antwerp can find the necessary information at
